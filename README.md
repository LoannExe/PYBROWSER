# PYBROWSER
## Pybrowser Usage

First of all, this browser is not the best out there, it is just super lightweight and takes up almost no ram.
I highly recommended doing a shortcut for the file "browser.pyw"


To use this browser, you need to install PyQt5, which is the requirement that basically makes it all possible.


### THIS BROWSER IS NOT FINISHED YET. IT HAS A SERIOUS LACK OF FEATURES.
